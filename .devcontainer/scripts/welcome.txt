Welcome to the colour-science dev-container!

If this is your first time opening the container you will want to set up the
poetry managed virtual environment by running

poetry install

from the project directory. Other useful commands to remember:

poetry shell

invoke tests        # Run tests in parallel

invoke quality      # Run type checking

invoke pre-commit   # Check a bunch-of stuff required by colour development 
                    # standards
