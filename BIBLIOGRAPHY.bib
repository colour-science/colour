  abstract = {\textcopyright{} 2017 ACM. The human visual system (HVS) non-linearly processes light from the real world, allowing us to perceive detail over a wide range of illumination. Although models that describe this non-linearity are constructed based on psycho-visual experiments, they generally apply to a limited range of illumination and therefore may not fully explain the behavior of theHVS under more extreme illumination conditions. We propose a modified experimental protocol for measuring visual responses to emissive stimuli that do not require participant training, nor requiring the exclusion of non-expert participants. Furthermore, the protocol can be applied to stimuli covering an extended luminance range. Based on the outcome of our experiment, we propose a new model describing lightness response over an extended luminance range. The model can be integrated with existing color appearance models or perceptual color spaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in high dynamic range applications, we evaluate its suitability for dynamic range expansion relative to existing solutions.},

  abstract = {Many different techniques are used for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth in the atmosphere. In some cases differences among these techniques can be important, especially in the UV region of the spectrum and under clean atmospheric conditions. The authors recommend that the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth be approached by going back to the first principles of Rayleigh scattering theory rather than the variety of curve- fitting techniques currently in use. A survey of the literature was conducted in order to determine the latest values of the physical constants necessary and to review the methods available for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth. The recommended approach requires the accurate calculation of the refractive index of air based on the latest published measurements. Calculations estimating Rayleigh optical depth should be done as accurately as possible because the inaccuracies that arise can equal or even exceed other quantities being estimated, such as aerosol optical depth, particularly in the UV region of the spectrum. All of the calculations are simple enough to be done easily in a spreadsheet.},

  abstract = {While each of his or her two eyes was independently adapted to a different illuminant in viewing a complex visual field, each of a number of observers matched a series of test colors seen by one eye with a juxtaposed variable stimulus seen by the other eye. The 2 degrees test and matching stimuli were located centrally in the complex adapting field, which subtended an angle of 31 degrees X 24 degrees. In making the matches, the observer viewed the test and matching stimuli for a series of brief intervals (approximately 1 sec) while viewing the complex adapting field with normal eye movements. Nine experiments were performed with different pairs of illuminants and different illuminances ranging from that of an average living room to that of a scene illuminated with hazy sunlight. In three other experiments each of the observer's two eyes was adapted to a different illuminance of D55. The amount of adaptation was more nearly complete at high levels of illuminance than at low levels, and the proportional amount of adaptation was less for the "blue" receptors. When adaptation coefficients were determined from the actual adaptation differences (e.g., from corresponding tristimulus values for matching neutrals) rather than from the adapting illuminants, a linear von Kries transformation based on experimentally determined visual primaries gave corresponding chromaticities that were in good agreement with the results obtained in each of the chromatic-adaptation experiments, except at the lowest illuminances. The results of the experiments in which each eye was adapted to different levels of the same illuminant indicated again that adaptation to the different levels was incomplete, the proportional amount of adaptation being less at low illuminances and for the "blue" receptors. This caused a change in chromatic adaptation with the level of illuminance even when the chromaticities of the adapting lights were equal. The results of these experiments also indicated that higher purities are needed in order to produce the same absolute color appearances at low levels of illuminance.},

To contain adapted colors within the positive cone-primary octan, it suffices to truncate the action of adaptation at the boundary of that octant.

Different techniques have been used to convert OSA-UCS-based color specification parameters, L, j, and g, to the CIE tristimulus values, X, Y, and Z. However, none of these methods provides a direct method of inverting OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ values. Thus, numerical algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson method, have been employed to obtain the transformations. The relative low accuracy and long computation time of this method makes it undesirable for practical applications. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to convert OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ. Its performance was compared with that of numerical methods. After optimization, ANN gave a better performance with a mean error (DeltaEXYZ) of 1.0x10(-4) and a conversion time of less than 1 s for 1891 samples.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of low-cost colour imaging devices in the consumer market has led to a greater need to transfer images from one medium or device to another without loss of colour fidelity. A common solution is to characterise each device in terms of its CIE tristimulus values. In this paper two general techniques, artificial neural networks and polynomial transforms, are compared for their usefulness in characterising colour cameras. The neural and polynomial techniques are shown to give approximately similar performance once the parameters of the models are optimised. Since neural networks can be difficult and time-consuming to train, it is concluded that polynomial transforms offer the better alternative for camera characterisation.},

A draft specification on color image encoding was published in September 2002 that recommended the use of XYZ color space, a gamma 1/2.6 transfer function, and 12 bits per color. With the support of Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI), a test was designed to verify these color image encoding parameters. This paper reports the results of the contrast sensitivity experiment, which showed that many of our observers could see a modulation corresponding to a one code value change with 10-bit encoding, but few observers would see a one-code value change with 12-bit encoding. This result matches the results of published contrast sensitivity experiments.},

The need for a UCS is demonstrated by the widespread use of the a*b* diagram despite the lack of uniformity. This article describes the development of formulas, with the same basic structure as the DIN99 formula, that predict the experimental data sets better than do the CMC and CIE94 colour-difference formulas and only slightly worse than CIEDE2000 (which was optimized on the experimental data).

The system quantifies the color fidelity and color gamut (change in object chroma) of a light source in comparison to a reference illuminant. The calculations are based on a newly developed set of reflectance data from real samples uniformly distributed in color space (thereby fairly representing all colors) and in wavelength space (thereby precluding artificial optimization of the color rendition scores by spectral engineering). The color fidelity score Rf is an improved version of the CIE color rendering index. The color gamut score Rg is an improved version of the Gamut Area Index. In combination, they provide two complementary assessments to guide the optimization of future light sources. This method summarizes the findings of the Color Metric Task Group of the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IES). It is adopted in the upcoming IES TM-30-2015, and is proposed for consideration with the International Commission on Illumination (CIE).},

  abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode\textendash based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0-100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

For the purposes of unambiguously specifying the color an observer sees when looking through an optical filter at a well-defined light source, we have found the CIE Color Specification System to be the most accurate (for a simple and clear description, see [1]). In this article we briefly describe the method to calculate the three main parameters that fully specify color in this system: luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity. These terms specifically refer to the definitions in the CIE system given below, but they have analogies in many other systems. A set of more general terms often used to qualitatively describe color are: brightness, hue, and saturation (analogous to luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity, respectively). These terms (and others) are often used interchangeably. Here we will adhere to the official terms assigned to the CIE system to avoid any ambiguity.},

This model consists of a modified von Kries transform that accounts for incomplete levels of adaptation. The model predicts that adaptation will be less complete as the saturation of the adapting stimulus increases and more complete as the luminance of the adapting stimulus increases. An experiment is described in which achromatic appearance is measured for various adapting conditions. The model is tested with these experimental results as well as results from another study and found to be significantly better at predicting corresponding colors than other proposed models.},

  abstract = {Cameras record three color responses (RGB) which are device dependent. Camera coordinates are mapped to a standard color space, such as XYZ\textemdash useful for color measurement\textemdash by amapping function, e.g., the simple 3\texttimes 3 linear transform (usually derived through regression). This mapping, which we will refer to as linear color correction (LCC), has been demonstrated to work well in the number of studies. However, it can map RGBs to XYZs with high error. The advantage of the LCC is that it is independent of camera exposure. An alternative and potentially more powerful method for color correction is polynomial color correction (PCC). Here, the R, G,and B values at a pixel are extended by the polynomial terms. For a given calibration training set PCC can significantly reduce the colorimetric error. However, the PCC fit depends on exposure, i.e., as exposure changes the vector of polynomial components is altered in a nonlinear way which results in hue and saturation shifts. This paper proposes a new polynomial-type regression loosely related to the idea of fractional polynomials which we call root-PCC (RPCC). Our idea is to take each term in a polynomial expansion and take its kth root of each k-degree term. It is easy to show terms defined in this way scale with exposure. RPCC is a simple (low complexity) extension of LCC. The experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that RPCC enhances color correction performance on real and synthetic data.},

  abstract = {In dieser Dissertation wird ein szenischer Bewegtbilddatensatz mit erweitertem Dynamikumfang (High Dynamic Range, HDR) und gro\ss em Farbumfang (Wide Color Gamut, WCG) eingef\"uhrt und es werden Modelle zur Kodierung von HDR und WCG Bildern vorgestellt. Die objektive und visuelle Evaluation neuer HDR und WCG Bildverarbeitungsalgorithmen, Kompressionsverfahren und Bildwiedergabeger\"ate erfordert einen Referenzdatensatz hoher Qualit\"at. Daher wird ein neuer HDR- und WCG-Video-Datensatz mit einem Dynamikumfang von bis zu 18 fotografischen Blenden eingef\"uhrt. Er enth\"alt inszenierte und dokumentarische Szenen. Die einzelnen Szenen sind konzipiert um eine Herausforderung f\"ur Tone Mapping Operatoren, Gamut Mapping Algorithmen, Kompressionscodecs und HDR und WCG Bildanzeigeger\"ate darzustellen. Die Szenen sind mit professionellem Licht, Maske und Filmausstattung aufgenommen. Um einen cinematischen Bildeindruck zu erhalten, werden digitale Filmkameras mit `Super-35 mm' Sensorgr\"o\ss e verwendet. Der zus\"atzliche Informationsgehalt von HDR- und WCG-Videosignalen erfordert im Vergleich zu Signalen mit herk\"ommlichem Dynamikumfang eine neue und effizientere Signalkodierung. Ein Farbraum f\"ur HDR und WCG Video sollte nicht nur effizient quantisieren, sondern wegen der unterschiedlichen Monitoreigenschaften auf der Empf\"angerseite auch f\"ur die Dynamik- und Farbumfangsanpassung geeignet sein. Bisher wurden Methoden f\"ur die Quantisierung von HDR Luminanzsignalen vorgeschlagen. Es fehlt jedoch noch ein entsprechendes Modell f\"ur Farbdifferenzsignale. Es werden daher zwei neue Farbr\"aume eingef\"uhrt, die sich sowohl f\"ur die effiziente Kodierung von HDR und WCG Signalen als auch f\"ur die Dynamik- und Farbumfangsanpassung eignen. Diese Farbr\"aume werden mit existierenden HDR und WCG Farbsignalkodierungen des aktuellen Stands der Technik verglichen. Die vorgestellten Kodierungsschemata erlauben es, HDR- und WCG-Video mittels drei Farbkan\"alen mit 12 Bits tonaler Aufl\"osung zu quantisieren, ohne dass Quantisierungsartefakte sichtbar werden. W\"ahrend die Speicherung und \"Ubertragung von HDR und WCG Video mit 12-Bit Farbtiefe pro Kanal angestrebt wird, unterst\"utzen aktuell verbreitete Dateiformate, Videoschnittstellen und Kompressionscodecs oft nur niedrigere Bittiefen. Um diese existierende Infrastruktur f\"ur die HDR Video\"ubertragung und -speicherung nutzen zu k\"onnen, wird ein neues bildinhaltsabh\"angiges Quantisierungsschema eingef\"uhrt. Diese Quantisierungsmethode nutzt Bildeigenschaften wie Rauschen und Textur um die ben\"otigte tonale Aufl\"osung f\"ur die visuell verlustlose Quantisierung zu sch\"atzen. Die vorgestellte Methode erlaubt es HDR Video mit einer Bittiefe von 10 Bits ohne sichtbare Unterschiede zum Original zu quantisieren und kommt mit weniger Rechenkraft im Vergleich zu aktuellen HDR Bilddifferenzmetriken aus.},

This system resembles the Adams chromatic-value system but replaces the quintic-parabola function with a cube-root function. For colors having reflectances greater than 0.5\% the color spacing obtained agrees with Munsell spacing as closely as the modified Adams system. At lower reflectances an expanded color spacing over that of the Munsell system is provided. The cube-root equations can be solved directly for color coordinate differences in terms of simple functions of the difference in colorimeter readings or tristimulus values. The computation of color coordinates in this system is simpler and requires less computational precision than other visually uniform color coordinate systems. A simple slide rule for computing color differences in cube-root color coordinates is described. A modification of the cube-root color coordinate system which provides nearly perfect representation of the spacing of Munsell colors is described, and the appropriateness of the assumptions required to obtain this behavior is discussed.},

The performance of I G P G T G on perceived hue data was compared to the performance of other established color spaces. Additionally, an experiment was run to directly compare the hue linearity of I G P G T G with those of other color spaces by using Case V of Thurstone's law of comparative judgment to generate hue-linearity scales. I G P G T G performed well in this experiment but poorly on extant visual data. The mixed results indicate that it is possible to derive a moderately hue-linear color space without visual data.},

To improve both the gamut and accuracy of these CCT calculations, we use chromaticities calculated from our measurements of nearly 7000 daylight and skylight spectra to test an equation that accurately maps CIE 1931 chromaticities x and y into CCT. We extend the work of McCamy [Color Res. Appl. 12, 285-287 (1992)] by using a chromaticity epicenter for CCT and the inverse slope of the line that connects it to x and y. With two epicenters for different CCT ranges, our simple equation is accurate across wide chromaticity and CCT ranges (3000-10(6) K) spanned by daylight and skylight.},

They are important for many computer vision tasks that use color information, such as multispectral imaging, color rendering, and color constancy. In this paper, we aim to explore the space of spectral sensitivity functions for digital color cameras. After collecting a database of 28 cameras covering a variety of types, we find this space convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and computational color constancy.},

However, perceptual color appearance under extended luminance levels has not been studied, mainly due to the unavailability of psychophysical data. Therefore, we conduct a psychophysical study in order to acquire appearance data for many different luminance levels (up to 16,860 cd/m(2)) covering most of the dynamic range of the human visual system. These experimental data allow us to quantify human color perception under extended luminance levels, yielding a generalized color appearance model. Our proposed appearance model is efficient, accurate and invertible. It can be used to adapt the tone and color of images to different dynamic ranges for cross-media reproduction while maintaining appearance that is close to human perception.},

We show that proLab is far ahead of the widely used CIELAB coordinate system (though inferior to the modern CAM16-UCS) according to perceptual uniformity evaluated by the STRESS metric in reference to the CIEDE2000 colour difference formula. At the same time, angular errors of chromaticity estimation that are standard for linear colour spaces can also be used in proLab since projective transformations preserve the linearity of manifolds. Unlike in linear spaces, angular errors for different hues are normalized according to human colour discrimination thresholds within proLab. We also demonstrate that shot noise in proLab is more homoscedastic than in CAM16-UCS or other standard colour spaces. This makes proLab a convenient coordinate system in which to perform linear colour analysis.},

Among the many, transforms tested, this transform gave the most accurate predictions to a number of experimental data sets. However, the structure of CMCCAT97 is considered complicated and causes problems when applications require the use of its reverse mode. This article describes a simplified version of CMCCAT97-CMCCAT2000-which not only, is significantly, simpler and eliminates the problems of reversibility, but also gives a more accurate prediction to almost all experimental data sets than does the original transform.

The current video distribution environments deliver Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) signal Y{${'}$}CbCr. For HDR and WCG content, it is desirable to examine if such signal format still works well for compression, and to know if the overall system performance can be further improved by exploring different signal formats. In this paper, ITP (ICTCP) colour space is presented. The paper concentrates on examining the two aspects of ITP colour space: 1) ITP characteristics in terms of signal quantization at a given bit depth; 2) ITP compression performance. The analysis and simulation results show that ITP 10 bit has better properties than Y{${'}$}CbCr{$\hyphenbullet$}PQ 10bit in colour quantization, constant luminance, hue property and chroma subsampling, and it also has good compression efficiency. Therefore it is desirable to adopt ITP colour space as a new signal format for HDR/WCG video compression.},

The model's performance was compared with the other spaces and models using the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data Set. The results show that LLAB(l:c) model is capable of precisely quantifying the change of colour appearance under a wide range of viewing parameters such as light sources, surrounds/media, achromatic backgrounds, sizes of stimuli, and luminance levels. It had a similar performance as that of the Hunt colour appearance model. The LLAB(l:c) model was also tested using various colour difference datasets. The model gave a similar performance as the state-of-the-art colour difference formulae such as CMC, CIE94, and BFD. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model, therefore, should be considered for field trials in applications such as colour specification, colour difference evaluation, cross-image reproduction, gamut mapping, prediction of metamerism and colour constancy, and quantification of colour-rendering properties. The model does not give predictions for chroma (as distinct from colourfulness), or for brightness, and it does not include any rod response. \textcopyright{} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 \AA{} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

  abstract = {Can a single colour model be used for all colorimetric applications? This article intends to answer that question. Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {An apparatus is described which facilitates the presentation of pairs of variable colors without variation of luminance. With this instrument, various criteria of visual sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed centrally with a surrounding field of fortytwo degrees diameter uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15 millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts. These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil, 2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously available data. The standard deviations of the trials are represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I. chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented as functions of position along straight lines in the chromaticity diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such representations are simpler than the traditional representations of wavelength thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram. The consistency of these data with the results of other investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of dominant wave-length.},

Our model is based on the stage theory of human color vision and is derived from data reported in electrophysiological studies. It is the first model to consistently handle normal color vision, anomalous trichromacy, and dichromacy in a unified way. We have validated the proposed model through an experimental evaluation involving groups of color vision deficient individuals and normal color vision ones. Our model can provide insights and feedback on how to improve visualization experiences for individuals with CVD. It also provides a framework for testing hypotheses about some aspects of the retinal photoreceptors in color vision deficient individuals.},

However, spectral rendering requires spectral scene data (e.g. textures and material properties), which is not widely available, severely limiting the practicality of spectral rendering. Unfortunately, producing a physically valid reflectance spectrum from a given sRGB triple has been a challenging problem, and indeed until very recently constructing a spectrum without colorimetric round-trip error was thought to be impossible. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for efficiently generating a reflectance spectrum from any given sRGB input data. We show for the first time that it is possible to create any sRGB reflectance spectrum as a linear combination of three separate spectra, each directly corresponding to one of the BT.709 primaries. Our approach produces consistent results, such that the input sRGB value is perfectly reproduced by the corresponding reflectance spectrum under D65 illumination, bounded only by Monte Carlo and numerical error. We provide a complete implementation, including a precomputed spectral basis, and discuss important optimizations and generalization to other RGB spaces.},

  abstract = {Four kinds of simple estimation equations are proposed for the Helmholtz\textemdash Kohlrausch effect. Two of them can be used for luminous colors, and the other two for object colors. In each of luminous and object colors, the two estimation equations are given to each of the Variable-Achromatic-Color (VAC) and the Variable-Chromatic-Color (VCC) methods. All the equations are similar in type to the Ware\textemdash Cowan equation. They give the ratio between luminance (or metric lightness) of test color stimulus and its equivalent luminance (or equivalent lightness) directly. Though their computations are simple, they can apply to various H\textemdash K effects including their adapting luminance dependency. The applicable fields of the proposed equations are wider than those of the Ware\textemdash Cowan equation. The proposed equations can be applied to predict the H\textemdash K effect within the whole chromaticity gamut including spectral colors, spectral luminosity functions based on direct color matching from 0.01 Td to 100 000 Td using the photopic and the scotopic spectral luminosity functions specified by CIE, equivalent lightness values of NCS colors, and others. \textcopyright{} 1997 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

All three dimensions have been carefully reviewed and extensively revised. The newly defined loci of constant hue have been extended closer to the extremes of value while the loci of constant chroma have been extrapolated to the pigment maximum. The dimension of value has been redefined without substantial departure from the Munsell-Sloan-Godlove scale. By the above changes a solid is achieved which approaches more closely to A. H. Munsell's dual ideal of psychological equispacing and precise applicability. The new solid is defined in terms of the I.C.I. standard coordinate system and Illuminant C.},

Multichip and phosphor-type white LED models were analyzed by simulation of their color characteristics and luminous efficacy of radiation, compared with those of conventional light sources for general lighting. Color rendering characteristics were evaluated based on the CIE Color Rendering Index (CRI), examining not only Ra but also the special color rendering indices Ri, as well as on the CIELAB color difference {$\Delta$}Eab* for the 14 color samples defined in CIE 13.3. Several models of three-chip and four-chip white LEDs as well as phosphor-type LEDs are optimized for various parameters, and some guidance is given for designing these white LEDs. The simulation analysis also demonstrated several problems with the current CRI, and the need for improvements is discussed.},

Such a color space should be able to represent a color pixel in three unique and independent attributes (lightness, chroma, and hue). Such a space would be perceptually uniform over a wide gamut, linear in iso-hue directions, and can predict both small and large color differences as well as lightness in high dynamic range environments. It would also have minimum computational cost for real time or quasi-real time processing. Presently available color spaces are not able to achieve these goals satisfactorily and comprehensively. In this study, a uniform color space is proposed and its performance in predicting a wide range of experimental data is presented in comparison with the other state of the art color spaces.},

A companion color encoding specification, known as Reference Input Medium Metric RGB (RIMM RGB), is also defined. This encoding can be used to represent images in an unrendered scene image state.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the specifications and usage of standard RGB color spaces promoted today by standard bodies and/or the imaging industry. As in the past, most of the new standard RGB color spaces were developed for specific imaging workflow and applications. They are used as interchange spaces to communicate color and/or as working spaces in imaging applications. Standard color spaces can facilitate color communication: if an image is in `knownRGB,' the user, application, and/or device can unambiguously understand the color of the image, and further color manage from there if necessary. When applied correctly, a standard RGB space can minimize color space conversions in an imaging workflow, improve image reproducibility, and facilitate accountability.\textbackslash nThe digital image color workflow is examined with emphasis on when an RGB color space is appropriate, and when to apply color management by profile. An RGB space is ``standard'' because either it is defined in an official standards document (a de jure standard) or it is supported by commonly used tools (a de facto standard). Examples of standard RGB color spaces are ISO RGB, sRGB, ROMM RGB, Adobe RGB 98, Apple RGB, and video RGB spaces (NTSC, EBU, ITU-R BT.709). As there is no one RGB color space that is suitable for all imaging needs, factors to consider when choosing an RGB color space are discussed.},

  abstract = {Chromatic adaptation transforms are used in imaging system to map image appearance to colorimetry under different illumination sources. In this paper, the performance of different chromatic adaptation transforms (CAT) is compared with the performance of transforms based on RGB primaries that have been investigated in relation to standard color spaces for digital still camera characterization and image interchange. The chromatic adaptation transforms studied are von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and CMCCAT2000. The RGB primaries investigated are ROMM, ITU-R BT.709, and 'prime wavelength' RGB. The chromatic adaptation model used is a von Kries model that linearly scales post-adaptation cone response with illuminant dependent coefficients. The transforms were evaluated using 16 sets of corresponding color dat. The actual and predicted tristimulus values were converted to CIELAB, and three different error prediction metrics, (Delta) ELab, (Delta) ECIE94, and (Delta) ECMC(1:1) were applied to the results. One-tail Student-t tests for matched pairs were calculated to compare if the variations in errors are statistically significant. For the given corresponding color data sets, the traditional chromatic adaptation transforms, Sharp CAT and CMCCAT2000, performed best. However, some transforms based on RGB primaries also exhibit good chromatic adaptation behavior, leading to the conclusion that white-point independent RGB spaces for image encoding can be defined. This conclusion holds only if the linear von Kries model is considered adequate to predict chromatic adaptation behavior.},
