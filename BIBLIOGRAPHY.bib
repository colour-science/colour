  abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 ACM. The human visual system (HVS) non-linearly processes light from the real world, allowing us to perceive detail over a wide range of illumination. Although models that describe this non-linearity are constructed based on psycho-visual experiments, they generally apply to a limited range of illumination and therefore may not fully explain the behavior of theHVS under more extreme illumination conditions. We propose a modified experimental protocol for measuring visual responses to emissive stimuli that do not require participant training, nor requiring the exclusion of non-expert participants. Furthermore, the protocol can be applied to stimuli covering an extended luminance range. Based on the outcome of our experiment, we propose a new model describing lightness response over an extended luminance range. The model can be integrated with existing color appearance models or perceptual color spaces. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in high dynamic range applications, we evaluate its suitability for dynamic range expansion relative to existing solutions.},

To contain adapted colors within the positive cone-primary octan, it suffices to truncate the action of adaptation at the boundary of that octant.

Different techniques have been used to convert OSA-UCS-based color specification parameters, L, j, and g, to the CIE tristimulus values, X, Y, and Z. However, none of these methods provides a direct method of inverting OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ values. Thus, numerical algorithms, such as the Newton-Raphson method, have been employed to obtain the transformations. The relative low accuracy and long computation time of this method makes it undesirable for practical applications. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to convert OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ. Its performance was compared with that of numerical methods. After optimization, ANN gave a better performance with a mean error (DeltaEXYZ) of 1.0x10(-4) and a conversion time of less than 1 s for 1891 samples.},

  abstract = {The color rendering index (CRI) has been shown to have deficiencies when applied to white light-emitting-diode{\textendash}based sources. Furthermore, evidence suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed. Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally, the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to span 0-100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated. Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

I G P G T G performed well in this experiment but poorly on extant visual data. The mixed results indicate that it is possible to derive a moderately hue-linear color space without visual data.},

Based on this statistical model, we propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions.

  abstract = {CMCCAT97 is a chromatic adaptation transform included in CIECAM97s, the CIE 1997 colour appearance model, for describing colour appearance under different viewing conditions and is recommended by, the Colour Measurement Committee of the Society, of Dyers and Colourists for predicting the degree of colour inconstancy, of surface colours. Among the many, transforms tested, this transform gave the most accurate predictions to a number of experimental data sets. However, the structure of CMCCAT97 is considered complicated and causes problems when applications require the use of its reverse mode. This article describes a simplified version of CMCCAT97-CMCCAT2000-which not only, is significantly, simpler and eliminates the problems of reversibility, but also gives a more accurate prediction to almost all experimental data sets than does the original transform.

The model's performance was compared with the other spaces and models using the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data Set. The results show that LLAB(l:c) model is capable of precisely quantifying the change of colour appearance under a wide range of viewing parameters such as light sources, surrounds/media, achromatic backgrounds, sizes of stimuli, and luminance levels. It had a similar performance as that of the Hunt colour appearance model. The LLAB(l:c) model was also tested using various colour difference datasets. The model gave a similar performance as the state-of-the-art colour difference formulae such as CMC, CIE94, and BFD. This performance is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model, therefore, should be considered for field trials in applications such as colour specification, colour difference evaluation, cross-image reproduction, gamut mapping, prediction of metamerism and colour constancy, and quantification of colour-rendering properties. The model does not give predictions for chroma (as distinct from colourfulness), or for brightness, and it does not include any rod response. {\textcopyright} 1996 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

Colour appearance models have been developed to predict colour appearance under different viewing conditions. They are also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their embedded uniform colour spaces. This article first tests the performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large- and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences having a large range of difference magnitudes. 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

As in the past, most of the new standard RGB color spaces were developed for specific imaging workflow and applications. They are used as interchange spaces to communicate color and/or as working spaces in imaging applications. Standard color spaces can facilitate color communication: if an image is in `knownRGB,' the user, application, and/or device can unambiguously understand the color of the image, and further color manage from there if necessary. When applied correctly, a standard RGB space can minimize color space conversions in an imaging workflow, improve image reproducibility, and facilitate accountability.{\textbackslash}nThe digital image color workflow is examined with emphasis on when an RGB color space is appropriate, and when to apply color management by profile. An RGB space is ``standard'' because either it is defined in an official standards document (a de jure standard) or it is supported by commonly used tools (a de facto standard). Examples of standard RGB color spaces are ISO RGB, sRGB, ROMM RGB, Adobe RGB 98, Apple RGB, and video RGB spaces (NTSC, EBU, ITU-R BT.709). As there is no one RGB color space that is suitable for all imaging needs, factors to consider when choosing an RGB color space are discussed.},

In this paper, the performance of different chromatic adaptation transforms (CAT) is compared with the performance of transforms based on RGB primaries that have been investigated in relation to standard color spaces for digital still camera characterization and image interchange. The chromatic adaptation transforms studied are von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and CMCCAT2000. The RGB primaries investigated are ROMM, ITU-R BT.709, and 'prime wavelength' RGB. The chromatic adaptation model used is a von Kries model that linearly scales post-adaptation cone response with illuminant dependent coefficients. The transforms were evaluated using 16 sets of corresponding color dat. The actual and predicted tristimulus values were converted to CIELAB, and three different error prediction metrics, (Delta) ELab, (Delta) ECIE94, and (Delta) ECMC(1:1) were applied to the results. One-tail Student-t tests for matched pairs were calculated to compare if the variations in errors are statistically significant. For the given corresponding color data sets, the traditional chromatic adaptation transforms, Sharp CAT and CMCCAT2000, performed best. However, some transforms based on RGB primaries also exhibit good chromatic adaptation behavior, leading to the conclusion that white-point independent RGB spaces for image encoding can be defined. This conclusion holds only if the linear von Kries model is considered adequate to predict chromatic adaptation behavior.},
