  abstract     = {{\copyright} 2017 ACM. The human visual system (HVS)
    non-linearly processes light from the real world, allowing us to
    perceive detail over a wide range of illumination. Although models
    that describe this non-linearity are constructed based on
    psycho-visual experiments, they generally apply to a limited range
    of illumination and therefore may not fully explain the behavior
    of theHVS under more extreme illumination conditions. We propose a
    modified experimental protocol for measuring visual responses to
    emissive stimuli that do not require participant training, nor
    requiring the exclusion of non-expert participants. Furthermore,
    the protocol can be applied to stimuli covering an extended
    luminance range. Based on the outcome of our experiment, we
    propose a new model describing lightness response over an extended
    luminance range. The model can be integrated with existing color
    appearance models or perceptual color spaces. To demonstrate the
    effectiveness of our model in high dynamic range applications, we
    evaluate its suitability for dynamic range expansion relative to
    existing solutions.},

    of Rayleigh optical depth be approached by going back to the first
    principles of Rayleigh scattering theory rather than the variety
    of curve- fitting techniques currently in use. A survey of the
    literature was conducted in order to determine the latest values
    of the physical constants necessary and to review the methods
    available for the calculation of Rayleigh optical depth. The
    recommended approach requires the accurate calculation of the
    refractive index of air based on the latest published
    measurements. Calculations estimating Rayleigh optical depth
    should be done as accurately as possible because the inaccuracies
    that arise can equal or even exceed other quantities being
    estimated, such as aerosol optical depth, particularly in the UV
    region of the spectrum. All of the calculations are simple enough
    to be done easily in a spreadsheet.},

    adapted to a different illuminant in viewing a complex visual
    field, each of a number of observers matched a series of test
    colors seen by one eye with a juxtaposed variable stimulus seen by
    the other eye. The 2 degrees test and matching stimuli were
    located centrally in the complex adapting field, which subtended
    an angle of 31 degrees X 24 degrees. In making the matches, the
    observer viewed the test and matching stimuli for a series of
    brief intervals (approximately 1 sec) while viewing the complex
    adapting field with normal eye movements. Nine experiments were
    performed with different pairs of illuminants and different
    illuminances ranging from that of an average living room to that
    of a scene illuminated with hazy sunlight. In three other
    experiments each of the observer's two eyes was adapted to a
    different illuminance of D55. The amount of adaptation was more
    nearly complete at high levels of illuminance than at low levels,
    and the proportional amount of adaptation was less for the "blue"
    receptors. When adaptation coefficients were determined from the
    actual adaptation differences (e.g., from corresponding
    tristimulus values for matching neutrals) rather than from the
    adapting illuminants, a linear von Kries transformation based on
    experimentally determined visual primaries gave corresponding
    chromaticities that were in good agreement with the results
    obtained in each of the chromatic-adaptation experiments, except
    at the lowest illuminances. The results of the experiments in
    which each eye was adapted to different levels of the same
    illuminant indicated again that adaptation to the different levels
    was incomplete, the proportional amount of adaptation being less
    at low illuminances and for the "blue" receptors. This caused a
    change in chromatic adaptation with the level of illuminance even
    when the chromaticities of the adapting lights were equal. The
    results of these experiments also indicated that higher purities
    are needed in order to produce the same absolute color appearances
    at low levels of illuminance.},

    Scales (OSA-UCS) is one of the color spaces that most closely
    approximate a "true" uniform color space. Different techniques
    have been used to convert OSA-UCS-based color specification
    parameters, L, j, and g, to the CIE tristimulus values, X, Y, and
    Z. However, none of these methods provides a direct method of
    inverting OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ values. Thus, numerical algorithms,
    such as the Newton-Raphson method, have been employed to obtain
    the transformations. The relative low accuracy and long
    computation time of this method makes it undesirable for practical
    applications. An artificial neural network (ANN) was employed to
    convert OSA-UCS to CIEXYZ. Its performance was compared with that
    of numerical methods. After optimization, ANN gave a better
    performance with a mean error (DeltaEXYZ) of 1.0x10(-4) and a
    conversion time of less than 1 s for 1891 samples.},

    in the consumer market has led to a greater need to transfer
    images from one medium or device to another without loss of colour

    terms of its CIE tristimulus values. In this paper two general
    techniques, artificial neural networks and polynomial transforms,
    are compared for their usefulness in characterising colour
    cameras. The neural and polynomial techniques are shown to give
    approximately similar performance once the parameters of the
    models are optimised. Since neural networks can be difficult and
    time-consuming to train, it is concluded that polynomial
    transforms offer the better alternative for camera
    characterisation.},

    2002 that recommended the use of XYZ color space, a gamma 1/2.6
    transfer function, and 12 bits per color. With the support of
    Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI), a test was designed to verify
    these color image encoding parameters. This paper reports the
    results of the contrast sensitivity experiment, which showed that
    many of our observers could see a modulation corresponding to a
    one code value change with 10-bit encoding, but few observers
    would see a one-code value change with 12-bit encoding. This
    result matches the results of published contrast sensitivity

    These formulas give much better fits for experimental data based

    associated uniform colour space (UCS). The need for a UCS is
    demonstrated by the widespread use of the a*b* diagram despite the
    lack of uniformity. This article describes the development of
    formulas, with the same basic structure as the DIN99 formula, that
    predict the experimental data sets better than do the CMC and
    CIE94 colour-difference formulas and only slightly worse than
    CIEDE2000 (which was optimized on the experimental data). However,

  abstract     = {We have developed a two-measure system for
    evaluating light sources' color rendition that builds upon
    conceptual progress of numerous researchers over the last two
    decades. The system quantifies the color fidelity and color gamut
    (change in object chroma) of a light source in comparison to a
    reference illuminant. The calculations are based on a newly
    developed set of reflectance data from real samples uniformly
    distributed in color space (thereby fairly representing all
    colors) and in wavelength space (thereby precluding artificial
    optimization of the color rendition scores by spectral
    engineering). The color fidelity score Rf is an improved version
    of the CIE color rendering index. The color gamut score Rg is an
    improved version of the Gamut Area Index. In combination, they
    provide two complementary assessments to guide the optimization of
    future light sources. This method summarizes the findings of the
    Color Metric Task Group of the Illuminating Engineering Society of
    North America (IES). It is adopted in the upcoming IES TM-30-2015,
    and is proposed for consideration with the International
    Commission on Illumination (CIE).},

    have deficiencies when applied to white
    light-emitting-diode--based sources. Furthermore, evidence
    suggests that the restricted scope of the CRI unnecessarily
    penalizes some light sources with desirable color qualities. To
    solve the problems of the CRI and include other dimensions of
    color quality, the color quality scale (CQS) has been developed.
    Although the CQS uses many of elements of the CRI, there are a
    number of fundamental differences. Like the CRI, the CQS is a
    test-samples method that compares the appearance of a set of
    reflective samples when illuminated by the test lamp to their
    appearance under a reference illuminant. The CQS uses a larger set
    of reflective samples, all of high chroma, and combines the color
    differences of the samples with a root mean square. Additionally,
    the CQS does not penalize light sources for causing increases in
    the chroma of object colors but does penalize sources with smaller
    rendered color gamut areas. The scale of the CQS is converted to
    span 0-100, and the uniform object color space and chromatic
    adaptation transform used in the calculations are updated.
    Supplementary scales have also been developed for expert users.},

    For the purposes of unambiguously specifying the color an observer

    be the most accurate (for a simple and clear description, see
    [1]). In this article we briefly describe the method to calculate
    the three main parameters that fully specify color in this system:
    luminosity, dominant wavelength, and excitation purity. These
    terms specifically refer to the definitions in the CIE system
    given below, but they have analogies in many other systems. A set
    of more general terms often used to qualitatively describe color
    are: brightness, hue, and saturation (analogous to luminosity,
    dominant wavelength, and excitation purity, respectively). These
    terms (and others) are often used interchangeably. Here we will
    adhere to the official terms assigned to the CIE system to avoid
    any ambiguity.},

  abstract     = {Cameras record three color responses (RGB) which are
    device dependent. Camera coordinates are mapped to a standard
    color space, such as XYZ---useful for color measurement---by
    amapping function, e.g., the simple 3{\texttimes}3 linear
    transform (usually derived through regression). This mapping,
    which we will refer to as linear color correction (LCC), has been
    demonstrated to work well in the number of studies. However, it
    can map RGBs to XYZs with high error. The advantage of the LCC is
    that it is independent of camera exposure. An alternative and
    potentially more powerful method for color correction is
    polynomial color correction (PCC). Here, the R, G,and B values at
    a pixel are extended by the polynomial terms. For a given
    calibration training set PCC can significantly reduce the
    colorimetric error. However, the PCC fit depends on exposure,
    i.e., as exposure changes the vector of polynomial components is
    altered in a nonlinear way which results in hue and saturation
    shifts. This paper proposes a new polynomial-type regression
    loosely related to the idea of fractional polynomials which we
    call root-PCC (RPCC). Our idea is to take each term in a
    polynomial expansion and take its kth root of each k-degree term.
    It is easy to show terms defined in this way scale with exposure.
    RPCC is a simple (low complexity) extension of LCC. The
    experiments presented in this paper demonstrate that RPCC enhances
    color correction performance on real and synthetic data.},

  abstract     = {In dieser Dissertation wird ein szenischer
    Bewegtbilddatensatz mit erweitertem Dynamikumfang (High Dynamic
    Range, HDR) und gro{\ss}em Farbumfang (Wide Color Gamut, WCG)
    eingef{\"u}hrt und es werden Modelle zur Kodierung von HDR und WCG
    Bildern vorgestellt. Die objektive und visuelle Evaluation neuer
    HDR und WCG Bildverarbeitungsalgorithmen, Kompressionsverfahren
    und Bildwiedergabeger{\"a}te erfordert einen Referenzdatensatz
    hoher Qualit{\"a}t. Daher wird ein neuer HDR- und
    WCG-Video-Datensatz mit einem Dynamikumfang von bis zu 18
    fotografischen Blenden eingef{\"u}hrt. Er enth{\"a}lt inszenierte
    und dokumentarische Szenen. Die einzelnen Szenen sind konzipiert
    um eine Herausforderung f{\"u}r Tone Mapping Operatoren, Gamut
    Mapping Algorithmen, Kompressionscodecs und HDR und WCG
    Bildanzeigeger{\"a}te darzustellen. Die Szenen sind mit
    professionellem Licht, Maske und Filmausstattung aufgenommen. Um
    einen cinematischen Bildeindruck zu erhalten, werden digitale
    Filmkameras mit `Super-35 mm' Sensorgr{\"o}{\ss}e verwendet. Der
    zus{\"a}tzliche Informationsgehalt von HDR- und WCG-Videosignalen
    erfordert im Vergleich zu Signalen mit herk{\"o}mmlichem
    Dynamikumfang eine neue und effizientere Signalkodierung. Ein
    Farbraum f{\"u}r HDR und WCG Video sollte nicht nur effizient
    quantisieren, sondern wegen der unterschiedlichen
    Monitoreigenschaften auf der Empf{\"a}ngerseite auch f{\"u}r die
    Dynamik- und Farbumfangsanpassung geeignet sein. Bisher wurden
    Methoden f{\"u}r die Quantisierung von HDR Luminanzsignalen
    vorgeschlagen. Es fehlt jedoch noch ein entsprechendes Modell
    f{\"u}r Farbdifferenzsignale. Es werden daher zwei neue
    Farbr{\"a}ume eingef{\"u}hrt, die sich sowohl f{\"u}r die
    effiziente Kodierung von HDR und WCG Signalen als auch f{\"u}r die
    Dynamik- und Farbumfangsanpassung eignen. Diese Farbr{\"a}ume
    werden mit existierenden HDR und WCG Farbsignalkodierungen des
    aktuellen Stands der Technik verglichen. Die vorgestellten
    Kodierungsschemata erlauben es, HDR- und WCG-Video mittels drei
    Farbkan{\"a}len mit 12 Bits tonaler Aufl{\"o}sung zu quantisieren,
    ohne dass Quantisierungsartefakte sichtbar werden. W{\"a}hrend die
    Speicherung und {\"U}bertragung von HDR und WCG Video mit 12-Bit
    Farbtiefe pro Kanal angestrebt wird, unterst{\"u}tzen aktuell
    verbreitete Dateiformate, Videoschnittstellen und
    Kompressionscodecs oft nur niedrigere Bittiefen. Um diese
    existierende Infrastruktur f{\"u}r die HDR Video{\"u}bertragung
    und -speicherung nutzen zu k{\"o}nnen, wird ein neues
    bildinhaltsabh{\"a}ngiges Quantisierungsschema eingef{\"u}hrt.
    Diese Quantisierungsmethode nutzt Bildeigenschaften wie Rauschen
    und Textur um die ben{\"o}tigte tonale Aufl{\"o}sung f{\"u}r die
    visuell verlustlose Quantisierung zu sch{\"a}tzen. Die
    vorgestellte Methode erlaubt es HDR Video mit einer Bittiefe von
    10 Bits ohne sichtbare Unterschiede zum Original zu quantisieren
    und kommt mit weniger Rechenkraft im Vergleich zu aktuellen HDR
    Bilddifferenzmetriken aus.},

    resembles the Adams chromatic-value system but replaces the
    quintic-parabola function with a cube-root function. For colors
    having reflectances greater than 0.5\% the color spacing obtained
    agrees with Munsell spacing as closely as the modified Adams
    system. At lower reflectances an expanded color spacing over that
    of the Munsell system is provided. The cube-root equations can be
    solved directly for color coordinate differences in terms of
    simple functions of the difference in colorimeter readings or
    tristimulus values. The computation of color coordinates in this
    system is simpler and requires less computational precision than
    other visually uniform color coordinate systems. A simple slide
    rule for computing color differences in cube-root color
    coordinates is described. A modification of the cube-root color
    coordinate system which provides nearly perfect representation of
    the spacing of Munsell colors is described, and the

    convex and two-dimensional. Based on this statistical model, we
    propose two methods to recover camera spectral sensitivities using
    regular reflective color targets (e.g., color checker) from a
    single image with and without knowing the illumination. We show
    the proposed model is more accurate and robust for estimating
    camera spectral sensitivities than other basis functions. We also
    show two applications for the recovery of camera spectral
    sensitivities - simulation of color rendering for cameras and
    computational color constancy.},

    the dynamic range of the human visual system. These experimental
    data allow us to quantify human color perception under extended

    Our proposed appearance model is efficient, accurate and

    to different dynamic ranges for cross-media reproduction while
    maintaining appearance that is close to human perception.},

    standard for linear colour spaces can also be used in proLab since
    projective transformations preserve the linearity of manifolds.
    Unlike in linear spaces, angular errors for different hues are
    normalized according to human colour discrimination thresholds
    within proLab. We also demonstrate that shot noise in proLab is
    more homoscedastic than in CAM16-UCS or other standard colour

    (WCG) content represents a greater range of luminance levels and a
    more complete reproduction of colours found in real⁃world scenes.
    The current video distribution environments deliver Standard
    Dynamic Range (SDR) signal Y{$\prime$}CbCr. For HDR and WCG
    content, it is desirable to examine if such signal format still
    works well for compression, and to know if the overall system
    performance can be further improved by exploring different signal
    formats. In this paper, ITP (ICTCP) colour space is presented. The
    paper concentrates on examining the two aspects of ITP colour
    space: 1) ITP characteristics in terms of signal quantization at a

    includes two parts: the BFD chromatic adaptation transform derived

    model's performance was compared with the other spaces and models
    using the LUTCHI Colour Appearance Data Set. The results show that

    colour appearance under a wide range of viewing parameters such as
    light sources, surrounds/media, achromatic backgrounds, sizes of
    stimuli, and luminance levels. It had a similar performance as
    that of the Hunt colour appearance model. The LLAB(l:c) model was
    also tested using various colour difference datasets. The model
    gave a similar performance as the state-of-the-art colour
    difference formulae such as CMC, CIE94, and BFD. This performance
    is considered to be very satisfactory, and the model, therefore,
    should be considered for field trials in applications such as
    colour specification, colour difference evaluation, cross-image
    reproduction, gamut mapping, prediction of metamerism and colour
    constancy, and quantification of colour-rendering properties. The
    model does not give predictions for chroma (as distinct from
    colourfulness), or for brightness, and it does not include any rod

    applicability of most small molecule and protein-protein docking
    tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking
    program Glide on a set of 19 non-{$\alpha$}-helical peptides and
    systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide
    sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the
    poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit
    solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top
    10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD {$\leq$} 2.0
    {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21\% with
    default Glide SP settings to 58\% with the enhanced peptide
    sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the
    native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the
    recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63\% success for
    these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster.
    Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound
    receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40\% of
    peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find
    that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for
    extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges,
    defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

    also capable of evaluating colour differences because of their

    performance of the CIE 2002 colour appearance model, CIECAM02, in
    predicting three types of colour discrimination data sets: large-
    and small-magnitude colour differences under daylight illuminants
    and small-magnitude colour differences under illuminant A. The
    results showed that CIECAM02 gave reasonable performance compared
    with the best available formulae and uniform colour spaces. It was
    further extended to give accurate predictions to all types of
    colour discrimination data. The results were very encouraging in
    that the CIECAM02 extensions performed second best among all the
    colour models tested and only slightly poorer than the models that
    were developed to fit a particular data set. One extension derived
    to fit all types of data can predict well for colour differences

    sensitivity to color difference have been investigated. The
    standard deviation of color matching was finally adopted as the
    most reproducible criterion. The test field was two degrees in
    diameter, divided by a vertical biprism edge, and was viewed
    centrally with a surrounding field of fortytwo degrees diameter
    uniformly illuminated so as to have a chromaticity similar to that
    of the I.C.I. Standard Illuminant C (average daylight). The
    luminance of the test field was maintained constant at 15
    millilamberts, and the surrounding field was 7.5 millilamberts.
    These fields were viewed monocularly through an artificial pupil,
    2.6 mm in diameter. Over twenty-five thousand trials at color
    matching have been recorded for a single observer, and the
    readings are analyzed in detail and compared with previously
    available data. The standard deviations of the trials are
    represented in terms of distance in the standard 1931 I.C.I.
    chromaticity diagram. These increments of distance are represented
    as functions of position along straight lines in the chromaticity
    diagram, and also as functions of direction of departure from
    points representing certain standard chromaticities. Such
    representations are simpler than the traditional representations
    of wavelength thresholds and purity thresholds as functions of
    wave-length, and the accuracy of the representations is improved
    by this simplicity. Chromaticity discrimination for non-spectral
    colors is represented simultaneously and on the same basis as for
    spectral colors. Small, equally noticeable chromaticity
    differences are represented for all chromaticities and for all
    kinds of variations by the lengths of the radii of a family of
    ellipses drawn on the standard chromaticity diagram. These
    ellipses cannot be transformed into equal-sized circles by any
    projective transformation of the standard chromaticity diagram.
    The consistency of these data with the results of other
    investigators is exhibited in terms of the noticeabilities of
    wave-length differences in the spectrum and of the noticeabilities
    of purity differences from a neutral stimulus, as functions of
    dominant wave-length.},

    three-primary decomposition. However, spectral rendering requires
    spectral scene data (e.g. textures and material properties), which
    is not widely available, severely limiting the practicality of
    spectral rendering. Unfortunately, producing a physically valid
    reflectance spectrum from a given sRGB triple has been a
    challenging problem, and indeed until very recently constructing a
    spectrum without colorimetric round-trip error was thought to be
    impossible. In this paper, we introduce a new procedure for
    efficiently generating a reflectance spectrum from any given sRGB
    input data. We show for the first time that it is possible to
    create any sRGB reflectance spectrum as a linear combination of
    three separate spectra, each directly corresponding to one of the
    BT.709 primaries. Our approach produces consistent results, such
    that the input sRGB value is perfectly reproduced by the
    corresponding reflectance spectrum under D65 illumination, bounded
    only by Monte Carlo and numerical error. We provide a complete

    proposed for the Helmholtz---Kohlrausch effect. Two of them can be
    used for luminous colors, and the other two for object colors. In
    each of luminous and object colors, the two estimation equations
    are given to each of the Variable-Achromatic-Color (VAC) and the
    Variable-Chromatic-Color (VCC) methods. All the equations are
    similar in type to the Ware---Cowan equation. They give the ratio
    between luminance (or metric lightness) of test color stimulus and
    its equivalent luminance (or equivalent lightness) directly.
    Though their computations are simple, they can apply to various
    H---K effects including their adapting luminance dependency. The
    applicable fields of the proposed equations are wider than those
    of the Ware---Cowan equation. The proposed equations can be
    applied to predict the H---K effect within the whole chromaticity
    gamut including spectral colors, spectral luminosity functions
    based on direct color matching from 0.01 Td to 100 000 Td using
    the photopic and the scotopic spectral luminosity functions

    have been extrapolated to the pigment maximum. The dimension of

    standard RGB color spaces promoted today by standard bodies and/or
    the imaging industry. As in the past, most of the new standard RGB
    color spaces were developed for specific imaging workflow and
    applications. They are used as interchange spaces to communicate
    color and/or as working spaces in imaging applications. Standard
    color spaces can facilitate color communication: if an image is in
    `knownRGB,' the user, application, and/or device can unambiguously
    understand the color of the image, and further color manage from
    there if necessary. When applied correctly, a standard RGB space
    can minimize color space conversions in an imaging workflow,
    improve image reproducibility, and facilitate
    accountability.{\textbackslash}nThe digital image color workflow
    is examined with emphasis on when an RGB color space is
    appropriate, and when to apply color management by profile. An RGB
    space is ``standard'' because either it is defined in an official
    standards document (a de jure standard) or it is supported by
    commonly used tools (a de facto standard). Examples of standard
    RGB color spaces are ISO RGB, sRGB, ROMM RGB, Adobe RGB 98, Apple
    RGB, and video RGB spaces (NTSC, EBU, ITU-R BT.709). As there is
    no one RGB color space that is suitable for all imaging needs,
    factors to consider when choosing an RGB color space are
    discussed.},

    system to map image appearance to colorimetry under different
    illumination sources. In this paper, the performance of different
    chromatic adaptation transforms (CAT) is compared with the
    performance of transforms based on RGB primaries that have been
    investigated in relation to standard color spaces for digital
    still camera characterization and image interchange. The chromatic
    adaptation transforms studied are von Kries, Bradford, Sharp, and
    CMCCAT2000. The RGB primaries investigated are ROMM, ITU-R BT.709,
    and 'prime wavelength' RGB. The chromatic adaptation model used is
    a von Kries model that linearly scales post-adaptation cone
    response with illuminant dependent coefficients. The transforms
    were evaluated using 16 sets of corresponding color dat. The
    actual and predicted tristimulus values were converted to CIELAB,
    and three different error prediction metrics, (Delta) ELab,
    (Delta) ECIE94, and (Delta) ECMC(1:1) were applied to the results.
    One-tail Student-t tests for matched pairs were calculated to
    compare if the variations in errors are statistically significant.
    For the given corresponding color data sets, the traditional
    chromatic adaptation transforms, Sharp CAT and CMCCAT2000,
    performed best. However, some transforms based on RGB primaries
    also exhibit good chromatic adaptation behavior, leading to the
    conclusion that white-point independent RGB spaces for image
    encoding can be defined. This conclusion holds only if the linear
    von Kries model is considered adequate to predict chromatic
    adaptation behavior.},
